## Why a Showcase Instead of Public Repos?

While I actively build full-stack and microservices-based applications, many of my projects remain private due to:

- Ongoing feature development and architectural refinements

- Proprietary or sensitive integrations (e.g., messaging pipelines, auth flows)

- Complex backend logic not ready for open source exposure

Rather than share incomplete or redacted code publicly, this Project Showcase is designed to give recruiters and hiring teams a clear, structured preview of:

- Technologies and frameworks Iâ€™ve worked with

- Real-world system designs and clean architecture practices

- Domain-specific solutions in healthcare, logistics, banking, and more

- UI/UX examples, architecture diagrams, and service-level breakdowns

If you'd like to see the actual codebase, schedule a walkthrough, or discuss any project in more detail, feel free to connect with me directly via [email](mailto:path2devhub@gmail.com)
